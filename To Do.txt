###Summary###
We will be creating a knowledge base. Clients will be able to interact with this tool from the command line.  They are
able to load in text files of assertions in order to build the initial knowledge base.  They can then assert facts/rules,
retract facts, and query the KB. We will be following a SQL lite model. We will be storing the entire KB in one file stored
on the disk, and when clients wish to access it, our program will access and modify that file, saving the changes onto
the disk.

Clients will enter rules and facts in as strings. Our program will be able to read those strings and determine whether it
is a rule or a fact.  It will then convert those strings into rule/fact structures. Our program will use symbols to refer
to various predicates and terms. The statement structure is made up of a series of terms, and will be used to uniquely
identify rules and facts

We want to monitor this program for performance (particularly with regards to querying and rectraction speeds). We will
perform benchmarking tests.


###Structures(See Code For More Detail)###
Create Knowledge Base Structure
Create Fact Structure
Create Rule Structure
Create Statement Structure
Create Term Enum
Create Assertion Enum


Main Functionalities:Assert, Ask, Retract
###Assert###
Add facts or rules into the knowledge base
Need to account for asserting the same rule twice- with arguments in different order
    We could set an invariant that the terms in the rule must be ordered in increasing
    ASCII characters.


###Ask###
input a fact to check if it is in the KB. Receive list of related (supported-by or supports) facts and rules

###Retract###
Remove facts from knowledge base
search through knowledge base and remove all facts or rules that are dependent on the removed facts

Why It's Interesting/What it will be used For
################################################
This library could be used to set and build rules for games or modeling certain scenarios/situations. It 
has to deal with sorting/managing/organizing complex logical relationships.

***Do Research Here!***



################################################
Why It's Challenging
################################################
We will have to make complex structures so our knowledge base can handle these large amounts of information and complex
relationships quickly and efficiently. We think the inferring facts aspect will be the most challenging as the knowledge
base must take all of the previous assertions into account as well as the new information when inferring new facts.

Miscellaneous (mostly addressing questions Jesse brought up in our conversation)
################################################

What happens if you issue a retraction for a derived fact?
    **IDK, I thought we couldn't do this? ***

Users will not be able to assert the same rule twice. If they try to do so, they will be given an error.

Rules with the same variables and predicates (logically the same), but in different orders, will be considered different rules.

Facts with the same constants and predicates (logically the same), but in different orders, will be considered the SAME.
    This is because of the way we will be tracking/storing predicates and terms using interned and uninterned symbols

In terms of the inference engine, we have two approaches: eager, and lazy. If we do the eager approach, every time a new rule
    or fact is asserted, we will go through the kb and add any facts from rules that were triggered by this assert (amount of 
    memory is proportional to the number of facts/rules that exist). In the lazy approach, the inference engine will only be 
    called when a user issues an ask command (only stores rules that have been asserted). The eager appraoch results in slow 
    asserts but fast asks, while the lazy approach is categorised by the opposite.

In terms of cache and storage, we need to decide how to implement this- do we write to the disk on every operation, does it 
    write on exit?, can a user call a function to write to disk?, does the program dump a file on exit?, are we modeling this
    as a distributable program, or is it client-server? Might consider caching one GB of facts, and evicting if you go over.
